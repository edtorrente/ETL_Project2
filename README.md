# Extract Transform Load (Project2)
  ## Use seperate datasets to compare and contrast Lebron James and Stephen Curry stats during their NBA playoff apperances.
  * Scoring Average
  * Career High Points
  * 3-pt. Field Goal Percentage

## Goals:
  * Extract information between two different datasets.
    - The Lebron file is a CSV file that has 262 rows and 27 columns while the Steph CSV has 5 rows and 21 columns. Fortunately, these sets contained plenty of         
    information and easily cleaned.
  * Transform the datasets by minimizing, filtering, selecting, and joining based on the needs of the project.
  * Load into a database- PostgresSQL.
